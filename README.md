## About this project
Goal of this project is to create machinelearning algorythm that can identify which direction is  arduino microcontroller facing (up,left,down or right) based on data from GY-61 sensor

## Project goals

- Create arduino code that reads sensor data and prints it to serial monitor
- Get arduino to send data to database
- Filter that data for machinelearning algorythm
